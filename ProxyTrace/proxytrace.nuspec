        <description>Here's a HTTP Proxy server that looks like tcpTrace (and is based on the same underlying asynchronous I/O engine). Simply configure your SOAP client to use a HTTP proxy server, leave all the addresses as normal, and off you go. As before you'll see a list of connections on left, simply select one, and the request / response HTTP messages will appear on the right.</description>
        <summary>You can use it for general HTTP stuff, want to see what your browser is doing under the covers, see all those double click cookies ?, fire up proxyTrace and switch your browser to use it a proxy server.</summary>
